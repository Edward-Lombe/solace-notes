- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) Home of it all
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) **N** ode **P** ackage **M** anager, pretty much any server side library will come from here
- [bower](http://bower.io) Similar to npm, but for front end packages (jQuery, Bootstrap, etc.)

- [Babel](https://babeljs.io) This allows use of ES6 in unsupported older browsers
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) A nice build + compile system.
- [Jade](http://jade-lang.com) Better than HTML, compiles down to it.
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) Same as above, but with CSS
- [node-soap](https://github.com/vpulim/node-soap) A nice library for parsing WSDLs
- [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io) Testing library
